  2. Editing House location details and storing to database:
     - We can give almost all house details with provided Edit fields
     - **This page also shows the selected house location with interactive map**
     - **Street adress for the house is auto generated base on the house location with the help of Geocoder**
     - If we give any invalid info it shows details of error corresponding to the field where the error occured
     - **Detects whether the provided House Name/To-let name is unique among all the House names belonging to that user**
     - Unique Id of the house is created in combination of the user Id and the house name and this unique house Id is used as key of the house
     - **The Unique house key along with the location is stored with as hashcode with the help og GeoFire library**
     - All information are stored in Firebase
     - **Checks whether the user was far away from the house while adding the house to determine whether the house is verified or not**
- Searching To-let:
  1. Selecting location around which search will be conducted:
     - Full Interactive map with dedicated button to show current location of User
     - Selecting current location
     - Long pressing the map to bring a marker(has person icon), the markers position selects search location
     - We can drag the marker to change the selected search location or to adjust the selected location properly
  2. Search results showing and filtering;
     - We can select the radius, with which we will conduct the search
     - We can Filter the search with the help of various fields
     - The filter fields also have error checking system
     - Resulting houses are showed on the map with a house icon
     - tapping on a house icon will show a short description of the house along with its verification status
     - All resulted houses are shown as a Scrollable list with short description
- Internet connection check is performed whenever internet connection is necessary and prompts the user through a dialog box to connect to the internet by taking them to the Wifi setting if they select so
- We can always get updated Database snapshot throughout the application by accessing the static member variable mDatabaseInfoHelper of HouseInfo class which is initialized at the start of the app
