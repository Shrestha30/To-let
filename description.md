Motivation:
-----------
Sometimes it becomes very dificult to find a rental home/apartments/houses(popularly known as To-let in our country),
And searching a rental house staying another place is quite a hassle
And sometimes the owner of the house can not get a renter for their rental house.

The motivation behind this project to solve these problems.

People can find any rental house added by their corresponding owner from anywhere in an instant with just few taps,
and owners of houses/apartments can easily rent their houses/apartments.
